            <p>Welcome basket weaver. You have been chosen by the transtemporal wizards to be transported back to 2016. You will have access to the tech of the future. Your task is to build decentralised tech alternatives to help your brothers in 2021 when they will need it.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Your inventory is looking bare and we will need to equip you for this task. The items below will make a fine warrior</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node</a>

                <li>
                    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Bills admittedly good IDE( MS WORD for code - its gonna have nice colours and make life easy )</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">Info on NPM</a>
                    
                </li>
            </ul>



            <p>Looking dangerous already!</p>

            <p>Boxes in green are holy texts you should read</p>

            <p>But first some guidance on basic code guidance. Guidance.</p>

            <p class="red">Although not used here ``` ``` means code  <br><br> $ means command line promts <br><br> And anything in a gray box will also be code. Usually the file extention will be stated above the code to tell you where to put it i.e. .js , .jsx , .css , .py </p>

            <p>Whats the command line? Open up a terminal on your computor, it should be an inbuilt application. It will likely look like a black/ white box with a couple lines of meaningless junk up top. This is where we put our command line promts. What were really doing is coding in a language called BASH</p>
            <p>Enter the code beneath in the terminal and see what happens. REMEBER! The $ sign only signals what language this is (BASH) omit it when pluging this code in the terminal.</p>

            <code>
                $ node -v
              
            </code>
<br>

            <code>
                $ npm -v
            </code>

            <p>That should have printed out some number for you.</p>

            <p>Now try the following</p>
            <code>
                $ ls
            </code>

            <p>Look familiar? This will give you your folders beneather your current folder</p>

            <p>copy/paste one of the folder names and append it to whats below</p>

            <code>
                $ cd 
            </code>

            <p>This will take you to a new foler</p>

            <p>You can confirm this with</p>

            <code>
                $ pwd
            </code>

            <p>Now make a new foler with: </p>

            <code>
                $ mkdir animeTiddies
            </code>

            <p>Now back to our quest - decentralised applications to help our brethren.</p>
            
            <p>The bottom line with keeping our data and information out of the hands of the jannys is:</p>
            <ul><li>Keep data encrypted</li><li>Keep data in more than one place.</li></ul>

            <p>Were going to use a suite of distributed databases and tools to help us out. Each of these tools being more poorly documented than last.</p>

            <p>A tidal wave of surplus chromosomes will embrace us on our journey to build our way out of the global elite's hamsterwheel! </p>

            <details class="detail"><summary>OSS Communities</summary> <br> OSS (Open Source Software) is a name given to projects who make their code open, they usually have communities developing them. If using them check to see when the last commits(additions to codebase) were, and if the community is active, large, and generally helpful. Its as easy to find cancer in these communities as any where else, but preference should always be given to OSS and active communities. Deprecated or old tech will slow you down and will almost always be a struggle to work with.</details>

            <hr>
            <p>Lets start writing code.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>We'll work with GUN and IPFS(no. no IPFS today)</p>

            <p>Enter your terminal and enter the following (remember to omit $)</p>

            <code>
                $ mkdir pel

            <p>Drag and drop this folder into your code IDE.</p>

<p>Images scroll horizontally (as god intended). Make an ep01 folder then index.html file as shown in last image</p>
            <p>Hopefully you got this far. If you have issues look up an introduction for your IDE.</p>

<details class="detail"><summary>CDN's</summary> <br>The interweb is built off the interweb. Pretty much every site that can allows you to creep, waste your time or loose money is using tech built by others. <br> This code built by others is delivered by one of two ways: Node Modules (remember installing NPM??) or CDN's. You might notice these cdn look like website URLs. Copy the URL to see whats there. Yep. And thats how be build. The Interweb is a sweaty mess of bodies piled onto of each other pulling functionality from everywhere. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-frontend-tools">Nice example of dogshite</a> <br></details>

<p>Grooooovy. Take care to get your ({})s right. Try add more data by fiddling around, but leave line 2 alone</p>
<p>Try get the individual primary value</p>
<p>Replace console.log with if your feeling saucy.</p>
<p>Try get a feel for using fuckery.js . link to it with a script with a src="" . Leave gun = Gun() inside html but take the rest to fuckery.</p>

<details class="detail"><summary>Tags</summary> <br> You might be seeing alot of `<>` - these bad boys are called tags and theyre are a few dozen different types. They break up the page and make this big, small, and seperated them. Remeber about how i said file types in code play nicely? Tags help with that. To use javascript in your code you use... the script tag. See above. Those CDN's were also script tags. The only difference is the script for the CDN's pointed us to somewhere.<br></details>


<p>Time to bring up running code - read whats beneath, save time and effort later on. </p>

<details class="detail"><summary>How to run code</summary> <br>Running code is THE largest obsticle to using other peoples shit in coding. For files to communicate with each other they often need to be built. You'll see how to build written in a readMe.md file and often it doesnt pose a problem but when it does it makes life hellish. <br> Web technologies have been built across the past 25 years and i lied about them playing nice. To fix this we have shit the joys that are: parcel, webpack, browserify, snowpack. Taking your life is the appropriate response to seeing these in the wild. <br> THE most responsable thing you can do as a developer is to keep builds nice and simple. "The fool admires complexity" - lord and saviour Terry.  <br><br> So what do you do when you find code you want to use? Check what its written in. Anything other than JS, rust, JSX will probably not give you a sparkly user interface and thats fine. <br><br>  1) If a repository is written in javascript find the index.html file - drag and drop into the browser. <br>2) If there is no index.html the repo might just have no GUI, thats ok, try build in some buttons <br> 3) use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve">serve</a> you may have found JS has stopped working when you dragged and dropped the file . Use serve.<br> 4) Check for package.json - this contains your dependencies, run ```npm install``` in the terminal IN THE FOLDER ,then check under the "scripts" in the package.json file for anything resembling "dev" , "start" , "build" if these exist you can ```run npm run dev``` etc. This will start the application. These command are not instructions in themselves, they are short-cuts to excecute BASH, which WILL be given after the semicolon in the package.json file. <br> 5) Almost all node issues can be solved with ```$ nvm i --lts``` this is the way to change what version of node your using its available <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">Here</a> and will probably need to be trouble shooted. Node issues most commonly come up when using frameworks. <br>  6) /build folers are designed for the files that run on the browser POST build. Its pretty retarded. It will most likely exist if the dev has decided to use twig or scss. Dont try rewrite twig into html just follow build steps and reestablish your connection with God. <br><br> All together pretty stupid, stroke enducing stuff. But you dedicated sage will pave the way forward.<br><br> Is this all a way for devs to increased learning curves and keep their jobs safe? No. </details>

<p>To run a html file drag it into the new tab section of your internet browser. Nothing will show up. 1)Right click 2) click inspect 3) click console <br>  <img class="imgDone" src="./ass/ep01/08.png" style="width:auto; height: 2em;" alt=""> </p>

<p>So whats gun and why did you waste my time? Gun is a database. The data were getting back can(next episode young one) be encrypted then placed on device local storage around the world by use of peers. If the glowies come for me then the data isnt going offline, because you hold it too.

    <br><br>Next time? user systems, encryption, files and confusion.
